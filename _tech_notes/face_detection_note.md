1. the difference between CV2. CascadeClassifier vs MTCNN:

CV2 conflict with pytorch? solved install python=3.7 and install opencv first then pytorch.

running test_batch_detections.py:
need module FaceBoxes
When I try to build FaceBoxes:
error: Unable to find vcvarsall.bat: 



https://github.com/yinguobing/cnn-facial-landmark:
running landmark.py
error: there is no example video to train the model, (no dir 'train.record') :Solved, generated by another repository

Error: Could not load dynamic library 'cupti64_101.dll'; dlerror: cupti64_101.dll not found:
Solution 1: Instll the version CUDA 10.1, and add the path to the environment variable.
Problem for solution 1: The path in cmd prompt(anaconda prompt) does not change even if I add it in the environment variable.
