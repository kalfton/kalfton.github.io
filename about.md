I am Kaining Zhang, currently a 5th year graduate student in Biomedical Engineering program in Washington University in St. Louis. My Ph.D supervisor is [Ilya Monosov](https://neuroscience.wustl.edu/people/ilya-monosov-phd/). Before that, I got my Bachelor degree in Physics from University of Science and Technology of China (USTC). 

I am enthusiastic about understanding the laws and logic behind phenomena in everyday life, in aspects of the natural and social world. 

In terms of the natural world, I like to learn Math and Physics, which reveal the fundamental laws that govern our world. I enjoy moments when the learning process rebuilt my beliefs and gave me a new viewpoint of the world.

In terms of the social world, I am interested in the behavior of humans and other creatures and the algorithms behind it. In my Ph.D period, I am studying how the brain implements algorithms to process novelty, surprise and uncertainty.

My other interests include climbing, snow skiing and ice skating.
