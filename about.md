I am Kaining Zhang, currently a 5th year graduate student in Biomedical Engineering program in Washington University in St. Louis. My Ph.D supervisor is [Ilya Monosov](http://neurosci.wustl.edu/People/Faculty/ilya-monosov). Before that, I got me Bachelor degree in Physics from University of Science and Technology of China (USTC). 

I am enthusiastic in understanding the laws and the logics behind the phenomena in everyday life, in aspects of nature and social world. 

In terms of the natural world, I like to learn Math and Physics, which reveals the fundamental laws of the world. I enjoy the moment when the learning process rebuilt my believes and gave me a new viewpoint of the world.

In terms of the social world, I am interested in the behavior of human-beings and the algorithms behind it. In my Ph.D period, I am studying how the brain implements algorithms to process novelty/surprise/uncertainty signals.

My Other interest includes: Climbing, snow skiing, ice skating, etc..
