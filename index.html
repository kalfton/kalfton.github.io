I am Kaining Zhang, currently a Postdoc in <a href="https://neuroscience.wustl.edu/people/gaia-tavoni-phd/">Gaia Tavoni</a> Lab. I build attractor network models to study memory retrieval. <br /> <br />

Before that, I got my Ph.D. in Biomedical Engineering at Washington University in St. Louis, and my supervisor is <a href="https://neuroscience.wustl.edu/people/ilya-monosov-phd/">Ilya Monosov</a>. Before that, I got my Bachelor's degree in Physics from University of Science and Technology of China (USTC). <br /> <br />

I am enthusiastic about understanding the laws and logic behind phenomena in everyday life, in aspects of the natural and social world. <br /> <br />

In terms of the natural world, I like to learn Math and Physics, which reveal the fundamental laws that govern our world. I enjoy moments when the learning process rebuilt my beliefs and gave me a new viewpoint of the world.<br /> <br />

In terms of the social world, I am interested in the behavior of humans and other creatures and the algorithms behind it. In my Ph.D. period, I am studying how the brain implements algorithms to process novelty, surprise, and uncertainty.<br /> <br />

My other interests include climbing, skiing/snowboarding, and ice skating.
