### About me
Hello! I am Kaining Zhang, currently a postdoctoral researcher in the <a href="https://neuroscience.wustl.edu/people/gaia-tavoni-phd/">Gaia Tavoni Lab</a>. I study the memory system using theoretical tools such as Hopfield networks and the replica method.

Previously, I completed my Ph.D. in Biomedical Engineering at Washington University in St. Louis, where I worked with <a href="https://neuroscience.wustl.edu/people/ilya-monosov-phd/">Ilya Monosov</a>. I received my bachelor's degree in Physics from the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC).

I am passionate about uncovering the underlying principles and logic behind phenomena in both the natural and social world.

In the natural world, I enjoy studying mathematics and physics, which reveal the fundamental laws that govern our universe. I find joy in moments when learning reshapes my understanding and offers a new perspective on reality.

In the social world, I am fascinated by the behavior of humans and other animals, and the algorithms that may underlie these behaviors. During my Ph.D., I used experimental approaches to study how the brain processes novelty, surprise, and uncertainty.

Outside of research, I enjoy climbing, skiing/snowboarding, and stand-up comedy.
